// <!-- Coding Challenge #1 Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). Your tasks:
//     1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
//     2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
//     3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Test data: Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall. */ -->

//     2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
//     Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ -->
