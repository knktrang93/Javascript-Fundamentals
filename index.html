    <!-- // Coding Challenge #1 Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). Your tasks: 
    1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
    2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
    3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Test data: Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall. */ -->

    <!-- Coding Challenge #2
    Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.
    Your tasks:
    1. Print a nice output to the console,saying who has the higher BMI.The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
    2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
    Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ -->
